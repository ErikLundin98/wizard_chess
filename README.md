# Wizard Chess

A hobby project of mine.

The idea is to make a game based on chess, but with more interesting pieces and game modes. The player should be able to choose between a wide range of pieces and decide which 16 pieces they want to use in their "army". Each piece is unique and has twists that make them different from the 6 types of chess pieces we are used to. For instance, a new Pawn piece might only move one square diagonally instead of vertically.

In the beginning, and for testing of game logic, the game will be played from the command line. Eventually, as I have developed a working concept, I will migrate it to a game engine. The plan for now is to use [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
